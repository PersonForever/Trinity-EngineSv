This is a tool Hunk Guerrius been working on for personal use. It auto generates a texture flag script for the external loader feature in Trinity\Abyss. 
It is very handy specially in scenarios where hundreds of external high resolution textures must be flagged for in-game usage.

I have decided to publish this along with the source code, I doubt many people are working with Trinity let alone someone that is making extensive use of the texture loader, 
but I have no reason to keep this private while the Trinity rendering engine is public, so.

Really hope anyone will find it useful, I surely did.

CHANGELOG:

V1.1
- Fixed issue with checking for existent script.

V1.2
- Renamed the tool to "Texture Tool" instead;
- Cleaned bits and pieces of code, nothing significant is changed.

V1.2.1
- Corrected a couple minor issues with generation process checks.
